Analyze the Employee Attrition dataset with the 1,470 values and 35 columns. The key goal is to understand the various perspectives of the employees as provided by the dataset, and further understand the factors potentially cause employees whether stay or leave that peripherally through the diverse visualizations and be concluded with the building of prediction models. 

Visualize the distribution of every column, and further explore the important relations between the column values. 

Apply the Logistic Regression  and TensorFlow Neural Network for creating two prediction models.

For the Logistic Regression model, the 87.755% accuracy rate is achieved; and for the Neural Network model, the 87.07% accuracy rate is achieved. 

The project is part of the KCL module 7SSDJ180 Research Project, which the full project will be published in the future.
